# The Ista'ga
The _Ista'ga_ is a historical record of the _Do'lita_

## The Fristi'la
- Té'mur and the fates reside in Ha'ðrú, the uppermost plane, along with [The U'rla](kinsladha.md#the-urla)
- Do'ður and Li'ðin found allied nations, with the princes and princesses forming provinces within their parents' nations
   - Do'ður founds Do'ðén
   - Li'ðin founds Li'ðén

## The Val'da
- Do'ður attempted a coup, The _Va'lda_, against Li'ðin and Té'mur. The Va'lda failed, resulting in Do'ður's imprisonment in Ha'lriþ, the underworld

## The Mi'dva
- With Do'ður imprisoned in Ha'lŕiþ, and thus unable to govern his nation, Li'ðén annexes Do'ðén. Following this, Li'ðén is renamed to Do'liðén

## The Fu'rða
- In ten thousand years Do'ður will escape, bringing the apocalypse, called The _Fu'rða_, and the deaths of Li'ðin's descendants
- After the deaths of her descendants, Li'ðin will kill Do'ður
- By Li'ðin's request, she is mercifully killed by Té'mur, as she could not live with herself after taking a life, no matter the justification
- Té'mur then rewinds time back to the beginning, in an attempt to prevent his sister's death
- This loop repeats infinitely
- It is unknown how many loops have happened, though estimates range from the thousands to the millions
- Té'mur is the only one with any memory of [The _Fu'rða_](#the-furða)
