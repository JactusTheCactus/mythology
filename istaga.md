# The Ista'ga
The _Ista'ga_ is a historical record of the _Do'lita_
## The Fristi'la
1. Té'mur and the fates reside in Ha'ðrú, the uppermost plane, along with *the Ur'la*  
2. Do'ður and Li'ðin found allied nations, with the princes and princesses forming provinces within their parents' nations  
   1. Do'ður founds Do'ðén  
   2. Li'ðin founds Li'ðén
## The Val'da
1. Do'ður attempted a coup, *the Val'da*, against Li'ðin and Té'mur. The Val'da failed, resulting in Do'ður's imprisonment in Ha'lriþ, the underworld
## The Mid'va
1. With Do'ður imprisoned in Ha'lŕiþ, and thus unable to govern his nation, Li'ðén annexes Do'ðén. Following this, Li'ðén is renamed to Do'liðén
## The Fur'ða
1. In ten thousand years Do'ður will escape, bringing the apocalypse, called *the Fur'ða*, and the deaths of Li'ðin's descendants  
2. After the deaths of her descendants, Li'ðin will kill Do'ður  
3. By Li'ðin's request, she is mercifully killed by Té'mur, as she could not live with herself after taking a life, no matter the justification  
4. Té'mur then rewinds time back to the beginning, in an attempt to prevent his sister's death  
5. This loop repeats infinitely  
6. It is unknown how many loops have happened, though estimates range from the thousands to the millions  
7. Té'mur is the only one with any memory of *The Fur'ða*
