	<h1>The Ista'ga</h1>
	<p>The <i>Ista'ga</i> is a historical record of the <i>Do'lita</i></p>
	<h2 id="fristila">The Fristi'la</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Té'mur and the fates reside in Ha'ðrú, the uppermost plane, along with <a href="kinsladha.html#gen-2a">The
				U'rla</a></li>
		<li>Do'ður and Li'ðin found allied nations, with the princes and princesses forming provinces within their
			parents'
			nations</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Do'ður founds Do'ðén</li>
			<li>Li'ðin founds Li'ðén</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="valda">The Val'da</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Do'ður attempted a coup, The <i>Va'lda</i>, against Li'ðin and Té'mur. The Va'lda failed, resulting in
			Do'ður's imprisonment in Ha'lriþ, the underworld</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="midva">The Mi'dva</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>With Do'ður imprisoned in Ha'lŕiþ, and thus unable to govern his nation, Li'ðén annexes Do'ðén. Following
			this, Li'ðén is renamed to Do'liðén</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="furdha">The Fu'rða</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>In ten thousand years Do'ður will escape, bringing the apocalypse, called The <i>Fu'rða</i>, and the deaths
			of Li'ðin's descendants</li>
		<li>After the deaths of her descendants, Li'ðin will kill Do'ður</li>
		<li>By Li'ðin's request, she is mercifully killed by Té'mur, as she could not live with herself after taking a
			life, no matter the justification</li>
		<li>Té'mur then rewinds time back to the beginning, in an attempt to prevent his sister's death</li>
		<li>This loop repeats infinitely</li>
		<li>It is unknown how many loops have happened, though estimates range from the thousands to the millions</li>
		<li>Té'mur is the only one with any memory of The <i>Fu'rða</i></li>
	</ul>
