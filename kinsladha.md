## Barons & Baronesses
- These Deities govern specific areas; islands, landmarks, lakes, oceans, etc.

## The Mak'ra
	Feminine: 	The Mak'rin
	Masculine: 	The Mak'rur
- _Not_ Deities
- Favoured mortals of a deity([King, Queen](#kings--queens), [Duke, Duchess](#the-urla), [Prince, Princess](#princes--princesses), [Marquis, Marchioness](#marquises--marchionesses)), giving them a fraction of their power
	- Each deity has their own system or reasoning for choosing a Mak'ra
		- Some like to follow certain bloodlines, while others do not
		- Some deities turn their favoured mortal into a Mak'ra when they reach adulthood, some when the mortal proves themself, and others do so in the mortal’s time of need
  		- _Some enjoy the __Chaos___
- Orders of magnitude stronger than a Wizard, but much weaker than actual gods
- Each Deity has a _Mak'ra_
- This status grants a mortal significant political power
- Most historical heroes are _Mak'ra_
	- Those that aren't are even more legendary
- Being gifted power by multiple deities is extraordinarily rare, but not impossible
	- There have only been several in history
	- Once, and only once, there was a _Mak'ra_ of Do'ður, Li'ðin and Té'mur, prior to [The Val'da](istaga.md#the-furða)
 	- This Mak'ra was _The First_
- When a _Mak'ra_ dies, a new _Mak'ra_ is chosen
- A _Mak'ra_ can lose their status if they do something that angers their patron, without a reasonable explanation
