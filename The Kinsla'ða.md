      1. Each deity has their own system or reasoning for choosing a Mak'ra  
         1. Some like to follow certain bloodlines, while others do not  
         2. Some deities turn their favoured mortal into a Mak'ra when they reach adulthood, some when the mortal proves themself, and others do so in the mortal’s time of need  
   3. Orders of magnitude stronger than a Wizard, but much weaker than actual gods  
   4. Each Deity has a *Mak'ra*

   9. A *Mak'ra* can lose their status if they do something that angers their patron, without a reasonable exlpanation
